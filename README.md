# Hash_table_analysis

###Introduction
In this project I have studied how a __hash-table__ based on the __chain method__ works. 
The main point of study is certain hash functions and programme performance depending on hash functions, table sizes and various loads.
- Input: L.N. Tolstoy's text 'War and Peace' (eng. version)
- Stress Testing: Search for each word in the list (element of Hash Table)
